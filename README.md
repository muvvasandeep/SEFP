HELPING HANDS:
  Our app acts as a connection between people who want to donate and to the helping organizations.
  Like,app consists of particular location,where all the helping organisations in this location is shown.Also,list of orphanage homes,oldage homes etc under one organisation is shown here.
  User selects any one of these which he likes to help.
  Then,we take certain details like in what form he is ready to help,at what time he is available so that helping organisations people can collect things from them etc and then organisations get in contact with them and they sort the things out.
  Also,photos of all the people who helped on a particular day are made available in the app.
  User account photos along with the things they helped,date and time are made available in his personal profoile.
